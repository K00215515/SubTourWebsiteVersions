            <h2>History of submarines</h2>
            <p>In the late 1800s after years of trial, error and fatal attraction, a handful of men made progress towards the realisation of the dream which were submarines. The traditionalists within naval hierarchies of several nation including Britian fought a bitter struggle trying to have submarines banned but experimental submarines produced by the likes of J.P Holland and Simon Lake began to show remarkable promise with submarines in spite of the volatile nature and the foul conditions onboard these experimental submarines. This set the course for the usage of submarines by navies across the world during conflict such as World War 1 and 2 up to the present day. The conditions have improved onboard submarines since the 1800s but a submarine is still a cramped space and the danger of being sunk and unable to escape the sunken vessel still lingers in the minds of sailors serving in the silent service (service on submarines is called this due to being it being undetectable by surface ships) across the world.</p>
            
            <h2>Shaping the future</h2>
            <p>Submarine warfare is on the brink of transformation with new submarines, concepts, technology and the demands of diversity in modern operational requirements. New submarines for example the Virginia class which is produced in the USA and the new British submarine the Astute class. Submarines like these are heralding the coming of fast, powerful attack submarines which are designed for the 21st century. Along with newer classes of submarines would be older ballistic boomers(name given to ballistic missile submarines) which have been upgraded to work alongside with submarines designed for the 21st century.</p>
            
            <h2>Disaster with the Kursk</h2>
            <p>Although submarines are useful in terms of naval warfare, there are dangers while serving onboard a submarine. A recent and most known disaster that happened after the Cold War was the Kursk disaster. The disaster happened on the 12th of August 2000 when two explosions were recorded by the Norwegian Seismic Institute, the second explosion was recorded as 3.4 on the Richter Scale. At first the Russian government (Kursk was a nuclear powered Oscar-class submarine and was part of the Russian Northern Fleet) admitted there a problem onboard the submarine however they passed this off as a major accident. Analysts from Western countries believed the explosions were caused by dangerous liquid hydrogen peroxide fuel to power the torpedoes onboard. After seven days, the Russian government accepted an international rescue effort after multiple failed rescue attempts. On the 20th of August the rescue team managed to get an escape hatch opened however all 118 sailors never survived the disaster. In 2001 the wreckage of the Kursk was raised to the surface where it was discovered the forward section of the submarine was blown apart. The Russian government later confirmed the cause of the disaster which analysts from the West summarised, there was a malfunction in the torpedo room which caused the hydrogen peroxide fuel to ignite when the Kursk were practising torpedo firings.</p>
