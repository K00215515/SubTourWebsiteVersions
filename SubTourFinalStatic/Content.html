                        <p>The Seawolf class costed the US Navy $3 billion for each submarine built and would become the most expensive submarine(s) to build and would operate autonomously against enemy vessals if a conflict occurs. Orginally 29 of these submarines were ordered however it was reduced down to 3 due to the end of the Cold War. The 3 submarines that are in service are Seawolf (the lead ship of the class was laid down in 1989 and commissioned in 1997), Connecticut and Jimmy Carter.</p>
                        
                        <p>The main role of the Seawolf is to search and destroy Soviet ballistic missile submarines before they could attack American targets in the event of a war however this changed due to the end of the Cold War. The US Navy claimed the sea trials in 1996 for the Seawolf proved that it would have the highest tactical speed of any US submarine.</p> 
                        
                        <p>Since stealth was a key feature for the Seawolf class it was also considered to be used for special forces operatons. A newly designed combat swimmer silo along with the SEAL Dry Dock Shelter (DDS) would provide these additional features during special forces operations. The DDS would of been placed on the back of the Seawolf submarines which can accommodate and launch a swimmer delivery vehicle and combat swimmers. The swimmers silo is an internal lock-out chamber that can deploy up to 8 combat swimmers and their equipment. </p>

                        <p>The Yasen(Project 885) class is one of the most submarine in the world today. The NATO code name for this class is "Severodvinsk" after the lead ship in the class which is the only one currently in service, 1 conducting sea trials (Kazan), 5 under construction (Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Arhangelsk, Perm and Ulyanovsk) and 3 more have yet to be under construction. The cost of each submarine is $0.8 billion far cheaper than the Seawolf class which was $3 billion each.</p>
                        
                        <p>It's considered as a growing primary undersea threat due to its enhanced capabilities and firepower by Western naval commanders. The lead ship Severodvinsk was laid down in 1993 and was commissioned into the Russian Northern Fleet (Arctic).</p>
